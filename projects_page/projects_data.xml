	<description>This block diagram depicts models A, B, A+, and B+. Model A and A+ lack the Ethernet and USB hub components. The Ethernet adapter is connected to an additional USB port. In model A and A+ the USB port is connected directly to the SoC. On model B+ the chip contains a five-point USB hub, of which four ports are available, while model B only provides two.he first generation Raspberry Pi chip operated at 700 MHz by default and did not become hot enough to need a heat sink or special cooling, unless the chip was overclocked. The second generation runs at 900 MHz by default, and also does not become hot enough to need a heatsink or special cooling. Again overclocking may heat up the SoC more than usual. Most Raspberry Pi chips could be overclocked to 800 MHz and some even higher to 1000 MHz. There are reports the second generation can be similarly overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500 MHz (discarding all safety features and over voltage limitations). In the Raspbian Linux distro the overclocking options on boot can be done by a software command running "sudo raspi-config" without voiding the warranty.[25] In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down in case the chip reaches 85 °C (185 °F), but it is possible to overrule automatic over voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty). In that case, one can try putting an appropriately sized heatsink on it to keep the chip from heating up far above 85 °C.</description>
